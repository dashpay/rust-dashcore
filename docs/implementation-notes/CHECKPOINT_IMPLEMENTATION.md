# Checkpoint System Implementation

## Overview
Successfully implemented a comprehensive checkpoint system for dash-spv based on the iOS implementation. This adds critical security and optimization features for blockchain synchronization.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Core Data Structures
- **Checkpoint**: Represents a known valid block at a specific height
  - Fields: height, block_hash, timestamp, target, merkle_root, chain_work, masternode_list_name
  - Protocol version extraction from masternode list names (e.g., "ML1088640__70218")

- **CheckpointManager**: Manages checkpoints for a specific network
  - Indexed by height for O(1) lookup
  - Sorted heights for efficient range queries
  - Methods for validation, finding checkpoints before a height, etc.

### 2. Checkpoint Data
Ported checkpoint data from iOS:
- **Mainnet**: 5 checkpoints from genesis to height 1,720,000
- **Testnet**: 2 checkpoints including genesis and height 760,000
- Each checkpoint includes full block data for validation

### 3. Integration with Header Sync
Enhanced `HeaderSyncManagerWithReorg` with checkpoint support:
- **Validation**: Blocks at checkpoint heights must match the expected hash
- **Fork Protection**: Prevents reorganizations past checkpoints
- **Sync Optimization**: Can start sync from last checkpoint
- **Skip Ahead**: Can jump to future checkpoints during initial sync

### 4. Security Features
- **Deep Reorg Protection**: Enforces checkpoints to prevent deep chain reorganizations
- **Fork Rejection**: Rejects forks that would reorganize past a checkpoint
- **Configurable Enforcement**: `enforce_checkpoints` flag in ReorgConfig

### 5. Test Coverage
- Unit tests for checkpoint validation and queries
- Integration tests for checkpoint enforcement during sync
- Protocol version extraction tests

## Usage Example

```rust
// Create checkpoint manager for mainnet
let checkpoints = mainnet_checkpoints();
let manager = CheckpointManager::new(checkpoints);

// Validate a block at a checkpoint height
let valid = manager.validate_block(height, &block_hash);

// Find checkpoint before a height
let checkpoint = manager.last_checkpoint_before_height(current_height);

// Use in header sync with reorg protection
let reorg_config = ReorgConfig {
    enforce_checkpoints: true,
    ..Default::default()
};
let sync_manager = HeaderSyncManagerWithReorg::new(&config, reorg_config);
```

## Benefits
1. **Security**: Prevents acceptance of alternate chains that don't match checkpoints
2. **Performance**: Enables faster initial sync by starting from recent checkpoints
3. **Recovery**: Provides known-good points for chain recovery
4. **Masternode Support**: Includes masternode list identifiers for DIP3 sync

## Future Enhancements
- Add more checkpoints for recent blocks
- Implement checkpoint-based fast sync
- Add checkpoint consensus rules for different protocol versions
- Support for downloading checkpoint data from trusted sources
