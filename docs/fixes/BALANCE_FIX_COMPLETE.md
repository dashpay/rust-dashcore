# Balance Callback Fix - Complete

## Fixed Compilation Errors

The following compilation errors have been fixed:

1. **FFIBalance field name**: Changed from `unconfirmed` to `pending` to match the C struct
2. **DashSDKError initialization**: Added required `code` and `message` parameters
3. **Balance calculation**: Now uses the `total` field from FFI instead of calculating manually

## Changes Made

### 1. SPVClient.swift
- Added `getAddressBalance()` and `getTotalBalance()` methods
- Fixed FFIBalance field mapping (pending instead of unconfirmed)
- Fixed error handling to include code and message

### 2. WalletManager.swift
- Updated `getBalance()` to call SPVClient's method
- Updated `getTotalBalance()` to call SPVClient's method
- Fixed unused variable warning

### 3. WalletService.swift (Example App)
- Added balance query after watching addresses
- Added balance refresh after sync completion
- Ensures balances are displayed immediately upon connection

## Result

The iOS app should now:
1. ✅ Compile without errors
2. ✅ Show balance immediately after connecting
3. ✅ Update balance when new transactions arrive
4. ✅ Refresh balance after sync completion

## Testing

The iOS libraries have been rebuilt. To test:

1. Open `Examples/DashHDWalletExample/DashHDWalletExample.xcodeproj` in Xcode
2. Build and run the app
3. Connect to a wallet with known balance
4. Verify that:
   - Balance appears after connection
   - Balance updates during sync
   - Transactions are visible

## Key Insight

The issue was that the Swift SDK was not calling the actual FFI balance query functions. The balance update callbacks only fire when new blocks contain transactions, so we need to actively query balances after adding watch addresses.
