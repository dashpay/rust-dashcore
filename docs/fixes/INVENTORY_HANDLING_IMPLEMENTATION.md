# Inventory Handling Implementation for Sequential Sync Manager

## Issue
The dash-spv client was showing the warning:
```
WARN Inventory handling not implemented for sequential sync manager
```

This meant that after initial sync, the SPV client would not stay synchronized with new blocks because it wasn't processing inventory announcements from peers.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Added `handle_inventory` Method
Added a new method to `SequentialSyncManager` that processes inventory messages when fully synced:
- **Block announcements**: Requests headers for new blocks
- **ChainLock announcements**: Requests ChainLock signatures
- **InstantSend lock announcements**: Requests InstantSend locks
- **Transaction announcements**: Ignored (SPV doesn't track individual transactions)

### 2. Added `handle_new_headers` Method
Processes headers that arrive after initial sync:
- Stores new headers in storage
- Requests filter headers if filters are enabled
- Initiates the filter checking process for new blocks

### 3. Enhanced Message Handling
Updated the `handle_message` method to process messages when fully synced:
- Headers from new block announcements
- Filter headers for new blocks
- Filters for new blocks

### 4. Added Post-Sync Filter Handling
- `handle_post_sync_cfheaders`: Stores filter headers and requests filters
- `handle_post_sync_cfilter`: Stores filters, checks for matches, and requests blocks if matched

### 5. Updated Client Integration
Modified the client to call the sequential sync manager's inventory handler instead of showing a warning.

## Workflow After Implementation

When a new block is announced via inventory:

1. **Inventory received** → Request block header
2. **Header received** → Store header, request filter header (if filters enabled)
3. **Filter header received** → Store filter header, request filter
4. **Filter received** → Store filter, check if it matches watch items
5. **If filter matches** → Request full block
6. **Block received** → Process transactions for watched addresses

## Key Features

- **Automatic synchronization**: Stays synchronized with the network after initial sync
- **Efficient filtering**: Only downloads blocks that contain relevant transactions
- **Support for Dash features**: Handles ChainLocks and InstantSend locks
- **Error handling**: Proper error propagation with descriptive messages

## Testing

After this implementation:
1. The warning no longer appears
2. New blocks are detected and processed
3. Filters are checked for watched addresses
4. Only relevant blocks are downloaded
5. Balance updates occur when new transactions arrive

This ensures the SPV client maintains synchronization with the Dash network and properly detects transactions for watched addresses.
