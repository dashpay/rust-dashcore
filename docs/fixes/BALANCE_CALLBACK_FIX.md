# Balance Callback Fix Summary

## Issue
The iOS app was not showing balance or transactions despite the SPV logs showing successful detection:
- SPV logs showed balance changes: `ðŸ’° Balance changes detected in block at height 0: Address yeYtjxQ3tW5pSY1GBiN4jBAiQqKHhmfBsV: +1 BTC`
- But the iOS app UI showed no balance or transactions

## Root Causes

1. **WalletManager not implementing balance queries**: The `getBalance()` and `getTotalBalance()` methods were returning empty Balance objects instead of calling the FFI functions.

2. **SPVClient missing balance query methods**: The Swift SDK's SPVClient wrapper didn't expose the FFI balance query functions.

3. **Balance not queried after adding watch addresses**: The app only relied on balance update events, but didn't actively query balances after initial connection.

4. **Balance total not calculated correctly**: When converting FFI balance to Swift Balance model, the total field wasn't being calculated.

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Added Balance Query Methods to SPVClient
```swift
// SPVClient.swift
public func getAddressBalance(_ address: String) async throws -> Balance
public func getTotalBalance() async throws -> Balance
```

### 2. Updated WalletManager to Use Real Balance Queries
```swift
// WalletManager.swift
public func getBalance(for address: String) async throws -> Balance {
    return try await client.getAddressBalance(address)
}

public func getTotalBalance() async throws -> Balance {
    return try await client.getTotalBalance()
}
```

### 3. Added Balance Updates at Key Points
- After watching addresses during connection
- After sync completion (both stream and callback methods)
- When balance update events are received

### 4. Fixed Balance Total Calculation
```swift
// When creating Balance from FFI struct
return Balance(
    confirmed: ffiBalance.confirmed,
    pending: ffiBalance.unconfirmed,
    instantLocked: ffiBalance.instantlocked,
    total: ffiBalance.confirmed + ffiBalance.unconfirmed + ffiBalance.instantlocked
)
```

## Testing

After these fixes, the iOS app should now:
1. Show balances immediately after connecting (if addresses have existing balances)
2. Update balances when new transactions are received
3. Refresh balances after sync completion

## Next Steps

1. Rebuild and test the iOS app
2. Verify balances are displayed correctly
3. Ensure balance updates work in real-time when transactions are received
