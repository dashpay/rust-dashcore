# Removal Execution Summary

## Actions Taken

1. **Backed up original file**: `masternodes.rs` â†’ `masternodes_old.rs`
2. **Created cleaned version**: `masternodes_cleaned.rs` with only essential methods
3. **Replaced original file**: Moved cleaned version to `masternodes.rs`

## Methods Preserved

- `new()` - Constructor
- `handle_mnlistdiff_message()` - Core MnListDiff message handling
- `process_masternode_diff()` - Internal diff processing (simplified)
- `check_sync_timeout()` - Timeout detection
- `start_sync()` - Basic sync initiation
- `request_masternode_diff()` - Network request method
- `engine()` and `set_engine()` - Engine access
- `is_syncing()`, `get_sync_base_height()`, `stop_sync()` - State management
- `validation_engine()`, `chain_lock_validator()`, `validation_state()` - Validation access
- `execute_engine_driven_sync()` - Placeholder for refactored implementation

## Methods Removed

- All terminal block related methods
- `start_sync_with_height()` and sequential sync logic
- `request_masternode_diffs_smart()` and complex request planning
- `request_masternode_diffs_for_chainlock_validation_with_base()`
- DKG window calculations
- Complex gap analysis logic
- Height progression logic

## Remaining Issues

1. **API Mismatches**: Some struct fields have changed (e.g., MasternodeState)
2. **Missing Methods**: Some sequential sync manager code expects removed methods
3. **SyncPhase Initialization**: New fields added to DownloadingMnList need updates

## Next Steps

1. Fix remaining compilation errors in sequential sync manager
2. Update all SyncPhase::DownloadingMnList initializations
3. Wire up the refactored implementation from `masternodes_refactored.rs`
4. Remove references to deleted methods in other modules

## File Size Reduction

- Original: ~2000+ lines
- Cleaned: ~400 lines (80% reduction)

The removal was successful, achieving a significant reduction in complexity while preserving the essential MnListDiff functionality.
