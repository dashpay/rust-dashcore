## ‚ö†Ô∏è AREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT

### High Priority

1. **Complete BLS Signature Validation** üö®
   - Required for mainnet security
   - ChainLock and InstantLock validation
   - Estimated effort: 1-2 weeks

2. **Document Lock Ordering**
   - Critical for preventing deadlocks
   - Lock acquisition order documented but could be more prominent
   - Estimated effort: 1 day

3. **Add Comprehensive Integration Tests**
   - Network layer needs more end-to-end testing
   - Full sync cycle testing
   - Estimated effort: 1 week

### Medium Priority

4. **Resource Management**
   - Add connection limits
   - Implement bandwidth throttling
   - Persist peer ban list

5. **Error Recovery Consistency**
   - Standardize retry strategies across modules
   - Add more detailed error context

6. **Type Aliases for Common Configurations** (Optional Convenience)
   - Add type aliases like `StandardSpvClient` for common use cases
   - Improves ergonomics while keeping generic flexibility
   - Note: The generic design itself is excellent for library flexibility

### Low Priority

7. **Extract Checkpoint Data to Config File**
   - Currently hardcoded in source
   - Would enable easier updates

8. **Consider Embedded Database**
   - Alternative to current file-based storage
   - Could improve query performance

## üìà METRICS

### Module Health Scorecard

| Module | Files | Health | Main Characteristics |
|--------|-------|--------|----------------------|
| sync/ | 37 | ‚úÖ EXCELLENT | Well-organized with filters/ and sequential/ fully modularized |
| client/ | 8 | ‚úÖ EXCELLENT | Clean separation: lifecycle, sync, progress, mempool, events |
| storage/ | 13 | ‚úÖ EXCELLENT | disk/ module with focused components (headers, filters, state) |
| network/ | 14 | ‚úÖ GOOD | Handles peer management, connections, message routing |
| validation/ | 6 | ‚ö†Ô∏è FAIR | Missing BLS validation (security concern) |

| types/ | 1 | ‚úÖ GOOD | Core type definitions (could be split further) |

### File Size Distribution

```
2000+ lines: 0 files  ‚úÖ (all large files refactored)
1000-2000:   4 files  ‚úÖ (acceptable complexity)
500-1000:    12 files ‚úÖ (good module size)
<500 lines:  95+ files ‚úÖ (excellent - focused modules)
```

**Largest Remaining Files:**
- `network/multi_peer.rs` (1,322 lines) - Acceptable for complex peer management
- `sync/headers_with_reorg.rs` (1,148 lines) - Acceptable for reorg handling
- `types.rs` (1,064 lines) - Could be split but acceptable

## üéì DEVELOPMENT GUIDELINES

### Adding New Features

**Before adding code:**
1. Check target file size (prefer <500 lines)
2. Identify appropriate module or create new one
3. Add comprehensive tests
4. Document complex logic
5. Update ARCHITECTURE.md if adding major features

### Working with Locks

**Critical lock ordering (to prevent deadlocks):**
1. `running` (client state)
2. `state` (ChainState)
3. `stats` (SpvStats)
4. `mempool_state` (MempoolState)
5. `storage` (StorageManager operations)

**Never acquire locks in reverse order!**

### Module Organization Principles

**Key design principles followed:**
- **Single Responsibility**: Each module has one clear purpose
- **Focused Files**: Target 200-500 lines per file
- **Clear Boundaries**: Public API vs internal implementation
- **`pub(super)` for Cross-Module Access**: Sibling modules can share helpers
- **Comprehensive Tests**: Tests live with the code they test

### Complex Types Explained

**`Arc<RwLock<T>>`** - Shared state with concurrent reads
- Used for: state, stats, mempool_state
- Pattern: Many readers OR one writer

**`Arc<Mutex<T>>`** - Shared state with exclusive access
- Used for: storage operations
- Simpler than RwLock when writes are common

**`CachedHeader`** - Performance optimization
- Caches X11 hash (expensive to compute)
- 4-6x speedup during header validation
- Uses Arc<OnceLock> for thread-safe lazy initialization

### Testing Strategy

**Test Types:**
- **Unit Tests**: Individual functions/modules (in-file with `#[cfg(test)]`)
- **Integration Tests**: Cross-module interactions (`tests/` directory)
- **Mock Tests**: Use MockNetworkManager, MemoryStorageManager
- **Property Tests**: Invariant testing (could add more with proptest)
