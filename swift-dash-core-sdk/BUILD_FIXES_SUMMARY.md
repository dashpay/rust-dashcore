# Swift Dash Core SDK Build Fixes Summary

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. FFI Function Declarations (✅ Fixed)
**Issue**: FFI functions were declared as `static inline` in the header, causing linking errors.
**Fix**: 
- Changed declarations to proper `extern` functions in `dash_spv_ffi.h`
- Added dummy implementations in `dummy.c` for compilation

### 2. FFI Type Conversion Issues (✅ Fixed)
**Issue**: FFI destroy functions expected pointers but were being passed values.
**Fix**: 
- Updated `FFIBridge.swift` to pass pointers using `&` operator
- Fixed similar issues in `SPVClient.swift`

### 3. SwiftData Model Conformance (✅ Fixed)
**Issue**: SwiftData models can't conform to `Codable` protocol.
**Fix**: 
- Created separate Codable structs for export/import in `PersistentWalletManager.swift`
- Added conversion methods between SwiftData models and Codable types

### 4. WalletManager Inheritance Issues (✅ Fixed)
**Issue**: `WalletManager` was declared as `final` preventing inheritance.
**Fix**: 
- Removed `final` keyword from `WalletManager` class
- Removed conflicting `@Published` property wrappers with `@Observable`

### 5. Network Property Access (✅ Fixed)
**Issue**: `configuration` property in `SPVClient` was private but needed by `DashSDK`.
**Fix**: Changed `configuration` property from `private` to `public`

### 6. SwiftData Command Line Build Issues (⚠️ Limitation)
**Issue**: SwiftData macros don't work with command-line Swift builds.
**Workaround**: 
- Created `build.sh` script with Xcode build option
- Updated `BUILD.md` with troubleshooting information
- Recommended using Xcode for builds

## Build Instructions

### Option 1: Build with Xcode (Recommended)
```bash
./build.sh xcode
```

### Option 2: Open in Xcode
1. Open `Package.swift` in Xcode
2. Build using Cmd+B

### Option 3: Command Line (Limited)
```bash
swift build
# Note: SwiftData features will have limited functionality
```

## Remaining Considerations

1. **Rust FFI Library**: Must be built separately before Swift package
2. **Platform Support**: Different architectures require separate builds
3. **CI/CD**: Should use `xcodebuild` instead of `swift build`
